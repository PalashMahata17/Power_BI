THis dashboard aims to transform raw financial data into a clear, interactive story of revenue and expenses—helping us, as a data science student, master Power BI while delivering real business insights.

Purpose & Vision ::

We want to track how your business unit generates and spends money over time. By visualizing monthly revenues, expense breakdowns, and year-over-year trends, you’ll spot patterns, seasonal effects, and cost drivers at a glance.
Dashboard Components
- Four KPI cards with embedded sparklines to show overall revenue, expenses, profit, and profit margin.
- A monthly bar chart for (2020,2021,2022,2023,2024) revenue, revealing peaks and troughs.
- A multi-year line chart to contextualize 2024 against prior years and projections.
- A bar chart breaking down 2024 expenses by account, highlighting top cost centers.
- A matrix table combining annual values and YoY percentages for revenue and profit.
Conceptual Rationale
Each visual serves a distinct purpose in the decision-making process:
- KPI cards deliver instant health checks.
- Monthly bars uncover short-term fluctuations and seasonality.
